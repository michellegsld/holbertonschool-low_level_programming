This is the README for the 0x0D-preprocessor directory within the holbertonschool-low_level_programming repo. We learn about the preprocessor (the first step within the C program compilation process). We also learn about macros and how to properly guard header files.

file name : description

0-object_like_macro.h : Header file that defines a macro named SIZE for the token 1024.

1-pi.h : Header file that defines a macro named PI for the token 3.14159265359.

2-main.c : Program that prints name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a newline.

3-function_like_macro.h : Function-like macro ABS(x), computes absolute value of x.

4-sum.h : Function-like macro SUM(x, y), computes sum of x and y.
