This is the README for the 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops folder within the holbertonschool-low_level_programming repo. We shall be learning to use even more nested loops, and create even more functions.

File name : Function description

0-isupper.c : Function checks for an uppercase character.

1-isdigit.c : Checks for a digit from 0 to 9, returns 1 else return 0.

2-mul.c : Multiplies two integers.

3-print_numbers.c : Prints numbers from 0 to 9, followed by new line.

4-print_most_numbers.c : Prints numbers from 0 to 9, followed by new line, but not 2 or 4.

5-more_numbers.c : Prints 10 times the numbers 0 to 14 followed by new line.

6-print_line.c : Draws a straight line in the terminal.

7-print_diagonal.c : Draws a diagonal line on a terminal.

8-print_square.c : Prints a square followed by new line.

9-fizz_buzz.c : Prints numbers from 1 to 100, followed by new line. Multiples of 3 print "Fizz" while multiples of 5 print "Buzz". If it's both then it prints "FizzBuzz".

10-print_triangle : Prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
