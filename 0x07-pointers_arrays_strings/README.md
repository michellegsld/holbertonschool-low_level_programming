This is the README for the 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings folder within the holbertonschool-low_level_programming repo. We shall be learning more about strings, pointers, and arrays, specifically a pointer to a pointer and multidimensional arrays. We get our first look at 2D arrays and a pointer to a pointer. We shall learn to use these as well as strings further in-depth.
