This is the README for the 0x03-debugging folder within the holbertonschool-low_level_programming repo. We shall learn about debugging as well as ways to debug. We should also be able to read error messages by the end of this.

Filename : description of what has to be fixed

0-main.c : Testing a function to give the correct output with '0'.

1-main.c : Comment out the part of code causing the output to go into infinite loop.

2-largest_number.c : Correctly prints the largest of 3 numbers. 

3-print_remaining_days.c : So it prints all dates and all leap years.
