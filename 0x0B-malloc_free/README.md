This is the README for the 0x0B-malloc_free directory within the holbertonschool-low_level_programming repo. We first start learning about malloc and free. We learn what they are and how to use them, we will use them in these programs: 

(file name : program description)

0-create_array.c : Creates an array of chars, initializes it with specific char.

1-strdup.c : Returns pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains copy of string parameter.

2-str_concat.c : Concatenates two strings.

3-alloc_grid.c : Returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.

4-free_grid.c : Frees a two dimensional grid previously created by your "alloc_grid" function.

5-argstostr.c : Concatenates all arguments of your program.

100-strtow : Splits a string into words.
