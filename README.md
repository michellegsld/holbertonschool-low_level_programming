This is the README for the holbertonschool-low_level_programming repo.

This is the repo that will contain C code, it's the first time we will use C at Holberton.

The purpose is to learn some more C language, as we were supposed to read some materials prior to our first day.
We will finally learn C! Yay! #cisfun

These are the folders within this repo:

0x00-hello_world : learn basics of C like what gcc is and how to use it.

0x01-variables_if_else_while : learn more C, use operators as well as
			       variables. Got to use a lot more for-loops and if-statements.
			       Nested a lot.
