This is the README for the holbertonschool-low_level_programming repo.

This is the repo that will contain C code, it's the first time we will use C at Holberton.

The purpose is to learn some more C language, as we were supposed to read some materials prior to our first day.
We will finally learn C! Yay! #cisfun
